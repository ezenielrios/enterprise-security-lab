# Lessons Learned – Lab 01

- Proper interface mapping is critical when virtualizing firewalls.
- Host-only networking is effective for secure management access.
- Misaligned subnets and DHCP conflicts are common failure points.
- Verifying services at the OS level helps isolate network vs application issues.

These observations informed adjustments to lab design and will be applied to future phases.
