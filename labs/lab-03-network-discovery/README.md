# Lab 03 — Network Discovery & Host Enumeration

## Objective
Identify live hosts on the isolated lab network using controlled discovery techniques prior to service enumeration.

## Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux (VMware)
- Network: Host-only (isolated)
- Scope: Local lab subnet only

## Methodology
- Validate attacker IP and scope
- Perform ARP-based discovery
- Perform ICMP-based host discovery
- Compare results for accuracy

## Tools
- ip
- arp-scan
- nmap (host discovery only)

## Evidence
Screenshots stored in:

## Notes
Discovery focuses on accuracy and scope control, not speed.
