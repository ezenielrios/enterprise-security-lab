# Lab 04 Notes – Firewall Control

## Goal
Validate pfSense rule enforcement (allow/deny) and confirm from client-side testing.

## Plan
- Baseline: confirm Kali routing + reachability to pfSense LAN IP
- Observe default LAN rules (typically allow LAN to any)
- Create one deny rule (tight scope) and validate change
- Document before/after with screenshots + command outputs
